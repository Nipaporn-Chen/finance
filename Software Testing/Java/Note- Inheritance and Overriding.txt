- Inheritance is a process where one class inherits visible properties from anothter class. Parent child relationship. 
- extends keyword is used in class declaration to inherit from another class. 
- child class will extend all visible (depends on access modifiers of variables and methods).
Access Modifers
- public : accessible from everywhere
- protected: accessbile within the same package
- default : accessible within same package and in the subclass.
- private : accessible in the same class only. 

*** Java doesn't support multiple inheritance because of the Diamond problem. 

*** If the child class wants to have its own implementation for methods defined in parent class, we can always overied these
methods in the child class. 

Rules of overrriding:
- Method name and number, order, and type of arguments should be exactly the same as the parent's method.
- Return type should be the same or covariant with the parent method. 
- The access modifier should be the same or more visible than parent method. 
- If exception declaration exists in the parent method, the child method can have the same type of exception declaration or
a smaller type. 
- *** final methods cannot be overridden. 

*** You cannnot override a variable; you can only hide it.
