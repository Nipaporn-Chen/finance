- Inheritance is a process where one class inherits visible properties from anothter class. Parent child relationship. 
- extends keyword is used in class declaration to inherit from another class. 
- child class will extend all visible (depends on access modifiers of variables and methods).
Access Modifers
- public : accessible from everywhere
- protected: accessbile within the same package
- default : accessible within same package and in the subclass.
- private : accessible in the same class only. 

How many classes one class can extend at the same time?
- Just one because java supports only single type inheritance.
*** Java doesn't support multiple inheritance. 


What's the difference between method overloading and method overriding?
  - overloading is when we have methods with different type, number, or order of arguments with the same name in the same class.
  - overridding when child class overrides parent class's methods. 

Rules of overrriding:
  - Method name and number, order, and type of arguments should be exactly the same as the parent's method.
  - Return type should be the same or covariant with the parent method. 
  - The access modifier should be the same or more visible than parent method. 
  - If exception declaration exists in the parent method, the child method can have the same type of exception declaration or
    a smaller type. 

- *** final methods cannot be overridden. 

*** You cannnot override a variable; you can only hide it. 

*** If the child class wants to have its own implementation for methods defined in parent class, we can always overied these
methods in the child class. 

Can you override static methods?
 - No, we cannot override static method(they will be hidden). 

Can you override constructor?
 - No. 

What will happen if child class defines the same variable as parent class?
  - parent class variables get hidden. 

What are the two classes that every class will extend from ?
  - There is No two classes. Every class will extend java.lang.Object.

How to prevent class from being extended?
  - make class final.

How to prevent method from being overrieded?
  - make method final.

How to compare custom object from the same class?
   1. We will override equals and hashCode methods.
   2. And use it for our comparision.
