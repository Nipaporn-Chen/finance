What's Encapsulation in Java?
 Data hiding(protecting) mechanism.

How do you achieve encapsulation?
 We achieve encapsulation by making instance variables private and by prividng prublic getters and setters. 

------
We should follow accepted coding style while providing getters and setters. 
-------
Why do we need to encapsulate?
- By removing direct access from instance variables and providing getters and setters, 
we have on layer where we can control what data can be assigned to objects properties.

From whom we are hiding the data?
- From the client code that will use our class. 

Encapsulated classes(by getters and setters) referred as POJO(Plain Old Java Object).
